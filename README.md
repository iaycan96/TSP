#	Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): 
Tsp is a problem which ,given a set of cities and distances between each pair of cities,and find the shortest possible way to visits each city and returns to the starting point.
By doing this each city must visited exactly one times.
To solve this problem ,I used nearest neighbour algorithm.

- Inputs are: n cities, with their locations (x and y coordinates) in a 2D grid.
- Output is: Ordering (tour) of these cities so that total distance to travel is minimized.
- Verifier: Checks if route is valid
